config
# - change Vyos router system to do DHCPv6
# - Note: Ethernet1 points to the Server network or 101, Ethernet4 points to the Client network or 201
#
# - Set up the DHCPv6 relay for the Vyos Router for the Client network
#
# - listen on this network interface on Vyos
set service dhcpv6-relay listen-interface eth4 address '2001:db8:302:201::1'
#
# - relay the requests to this host
set service dhcpv6-relay upstream-interface eth1 address '2001:db8:302:101::10'
#
# - turn on the managed flag
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert managed-flag 'true'
#
# - you can optionally turn on the other flag - but you don't really need too - recommend leaving it off
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert other-config-flag 'false'
# set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert other-config-flag 'true'
#
# - turn off the autonomous flag
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert prefix 2001:db8:302:101::/64 autonomous-flag 'false'
#
# - advertise the new info out with an RA so hosts know that DHCPv6 is now enabled
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert send-advert 'true'
#
#
#
# - optionally build out the same for the Server network
# - you should be able to figure out how to do that on your own from the above...
#
#
# - script for Vyos router to change from DHCPv6 to SLAAC for Client network, turn off M and O, and turn on A flag
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert managed-flag 'false'
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert other-config-flag 'false'
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert prefix 2001:db8:302:101::/64 autonomous-flag 'true'
#
#
# - script for vyos to run both DHCPv6 and SLAAC (what?!?) - turn on M, O, and A
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert managed-flag 'true'
set interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6 router-advert other-config-flag 'true'
