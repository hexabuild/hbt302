Mac:
Don’t mess with Mac OS X – IPv6 is on by default and it is mainly a client OS and there is no good rational reason to change the default settings. With all Mac OS updates, most of the settings for IPv6 will be reset to the default anyway, so reduce frustration and accept the default configuration.

Apple uses their own optimized version of RFC 8305 (newest version of Happy Eyeballs RFC 6555 - which the Apple team helped write) so it is specialized and not intuitive about what it is doing under the covers. Apple IOS uses similar but not necessarily the same optimizations.
